# Note:

This is not meant to be "used" in any code, it's simply a toy implementation of an arbitrary precision arithmetic system. 
I originally built this to solve [Problem 13 from Project Euler in Rust](https://github.com/ProfHercules/eule-rs/blob/main/src/main.rs), but I ended up going with a different solution.

Still, it was fun to implement & I may come back to work on it in the future.
